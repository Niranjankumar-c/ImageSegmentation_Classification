# ImageSegmentation_Classification

**Business Context**:
- Healthcare organizations often deal with a significant volume of handwritten medical documents, including forms, prescriptions, and patient records. Manual digitization and analysis of these documents are time-consuming, error-prone, and resource-intensive, leading to inefficiencies and potential errors in patient care.
- To address these challenges, there is a need for an automated system that can accurately digitize and classify handwritten characters on medical documents, enabling efficient data entry and analysis.

**Objective**:
- Develop a deep learning-based solution capable of accurately classifying handwritten characters on medical documents using the MNIST dataset as a benchmark.
- The system should automatically process handwritten images, classify them into their respective digit categories (0 through 9), and output the digitized text for further analysis.
- The primary objective is to improve the efficiency, accuracy, and reliability of digitization processes in healthcare, ultimately enhancing patient care and administrative workflows
